# OpenFOAMVis
OpenFOAMVis provides in-situ visualization applications for OpenFOAM solvers. These applications use an in-situ visualization framework ([InSituVis](https://github.com/vizlab-kobe/InSituVis)) implemented by using [KVS](https://github.com/naohisas/KVS).

## Installation

### Pre-requisities

The follwoing packages needs to be installed before compiling SmokeRingVis.
- [KVS](https://github.com/naohisas/KVS)
- [InSituVis](https://github.com/vizlab-kobe/InSituVis)

#### KVS
KVS supports OSMesa and MPI needs to be installed.

1. Install OSMesa and MPI

    OSMesa and MPI need to be install before compile the KVS. Please refer to the followin URLs to install them.<br>
    - [OSMesa](https://github.com/naohisas/KVS/blob/develop/Source/SupportOSMesa/README.md)
    - [MPI](https://github.com/naohisas/KVS/blob/develop/Source/SupportMPI/README.md)

2. Get KVS source codes from the GitHub repository as follows:
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/naohisas/KVS.git
    ```

3. Modify kvs.conf as follows:
    ```
    $ cd KVS
    $ <modify kvs.conf>

    - Change the following items from 0(disable) to 1(enable).<br>
    ```
    KVS_ENABLE_OPENGL     = 1
    KVS_SUPPORT_MPI       = 1
    KVS_SUPPORT_OSMESA    = 1
    ```
    - Change the following items from 1(enable) to 0(disable).<br>
    ```
    KVS_SUPPORT_GLU       = 0
    KVS_SUPPORT_GLUT      = 0
    ```
    - Change the following items to 1 if needed. <br>
    ```
